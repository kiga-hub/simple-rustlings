## Quick Test Rust Code

Use the rustlings project for quick testing of Rust code.

Some less commonly used exercises have been removed, only some commonly used exercises are retained.

Editable files are under the exercises directory, and the code to run is selected through info.toml.

### Run

```bash
# Compilation only needs to be done once
cargo build
./target/debug/kiga run intro
# Or
./target/debug/kiga run test
```

### Follow-up

The source code of the rustlings project will be annotated in the future to facilitate understanding of Rust syntax.
